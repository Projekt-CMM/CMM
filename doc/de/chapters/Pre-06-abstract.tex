C Compact is a simple but powerful development environment for a programming language similar to C. It is especially adjusted to the needs of programming beginners who often have troubles understanding the way a program works and the logic it is based on.

In contrast to professional IDEs, C Compact can be used easily and in an intuitive way. However, it also provides the full range of features that are needed for programming lessons at technical schools. C Compact can be used to aquire simple tasks as well as to develop complex algorithms.

This IDE is intended for the use in programming lessons in the first two grades of Austrian technical colleges (HTL). Though, C Compact is not limited to this application. It can also be used for advanced training or programming courses as well as by hobby programmers.

C Compact is distributed under the terms of GNU General Public License and is therefore free software.
